- Scientific software ([[PyMol]], [[ChimeraX]], [[Molstar]])
	- Science first
	- Graphical fidelity of sceondary concern
	- re-implementing their own graphics
	- limited graphic fidelity (not the intended purpose)
- 3D Software ([[Blender]], [[Maya]], [[Cinema4D]], [[Houdini]])
	- Graphics first
	- Great capabilities for creating 3D scenes
	- Photoreal & non-photorealistic rendering techniques
	- unaware of structural biology data formats
	- not [[Biologically Lliterate]]

There is a clear distinction between general 3D software pacakges that are often used in film, TV and video game production, and the kind of 3D software packages that are available for structural biology data analysis.

The scientifically-oriented software excels at its purpose of being able to display and analyse structural biology datasets, such as `.pdb` files and molecular dynamics trajectories. It lacks however more compelling visual fidelity that is found inside of purpose-built 3D packages like Maya or Blender, which are designed with photorealistic rendering or use in games and movies in mind.
