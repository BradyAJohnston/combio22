Unable to understand biologically-relevant data files and structures.

While there are certain addons that exist for differet software such as [[Blender]], [[Maya]] and [[Cinema4D]], they usually result in juts being the intermediate in the creation of 3D geometry that is then passed off to the 3D program.

There is a difference between being able to parse a `.pdb` file and generate some 3D geometry, and being able to continually update that 3D geometry based on updates to the underlying data, or to modify the underlying data based on scientifically-relevant rules that must be followed.
